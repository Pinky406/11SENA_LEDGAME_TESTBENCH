# 11SENA_LEDGAME_TESTBENCH

In this area of study students produce, test, diagnose and evaluate operational electrotechnological systems. Using
the systems engineering process, students use a range of materials, tools, equipment, machines and components
and manage identified risks while producing the system designed in Area of Study 1. They use appropriate equipment
to test the system and diagnose its performance, making necessary modifications and adjustments. They record
progress and evaluate the integrated system and their use of the systems engineering process, referring to the
factors that influence their creation of the system. Students suggest how the system and their utilisation of the
systems engineering process could be improved.
